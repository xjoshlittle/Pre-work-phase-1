<h1> Pre-work phase 1</h1>
<p> git is version control software on your computer</p>
<p> We COMMIT our code versions to git on our computer</p>
<p> github.com is a cloud service that works with git to help us collaborate and share our code</p>
<p> We PUSH our code to github.com</p>
<p> We Deploy our projects to a server so that the world can view them in a browser on a computer.</p>
<p> In the bootcamp we DEPLOY to the bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu server</p>
